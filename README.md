# Spotify Genre Recommender
## Helping users get hands-on with their music expansion
Spotify is a huge platform, lots of money via advertising and subscription

## Working with genres
More than 5k genres listed
1 to 21 tags per artist, average 1.5, 

## Heirarchical clustering of genres

Reduce genres to top 1000?
